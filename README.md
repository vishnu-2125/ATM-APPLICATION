# ATM-APPLICATION
Developed a web-based ATM Application using Python Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The application simulates real-world ATM functionalities by providing a secure and interactive user interface for performing basic banking operations.

The system allows users to  such as balance inquiry, cash deposit, and cash withdrawal. Flask handles routing, business logic, and server-side validation, while the frontend ensures a responsive and user-friendly experience.

Data handling and transaction logic are implemented efficiently to ensure accuracy, security, and smooth user interaction, closely mimicking the behavior of an actual ATM system.
